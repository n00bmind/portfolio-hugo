### dodo-lang
A sandbox to explore language design ideas while I learn more about compilers. I had written my own scripting language before, but never a "real" language, and never writing all the code myself from scratch. At the moment it's just barely a transpiler to C, but I hope to continue adding code generation and maybe even explore some optimization techniques.

### robotrider
An engine/game still in very early development. Started as a way to explore less common practices in the industry (such as avoiding OOP and external dependencies as much as possible) and also to learn concepts and techniques which Iâ€™ve never had the chance to explore in depth before (fully custom-made platform layer, custom memory allocators, hot-reloading of code/data/shaders, PCG, etc)

A few interesting topics I've been exploring since I started:
- Marching cubes & dual contouring
- Mesh simplification & QEF minimization
- Wave function collapse
