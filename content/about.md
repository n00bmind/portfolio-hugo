Welcome!

I'm Oscar Pe√±as. I was born a loong time ago somewhere in the south coast of Spain.<br/>
I've been interested in computers almost since I can remember, ever since I got my amazing 8086 as a birthday present I felt so very curious about how it did what it did.

However it was when I first discovered the demoscene, in the mid 90s, that I really was hooked forever. I _had to_ learn how to do all that! And so, well... here we are.

During my career I've always been happier in gamedev, as I think it's the only field that shares a bit of that spirit and challenge. On this site you can find some of my related professional experience and some of the stuff I do in my (scarce) spare time.
